# 📞 Phonebook App

This is a Java console application that allows users to search for contacts by name or phone number using data stored in a local text file. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as object-oriented design, file handling, and exception management.

## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 **Lookup**: Search for a person's phone number using their first and last name.
- 🔁 **Reverse Lookup**: Find a person's name using their phone number.
- 🧾 Reads entries from a local `phonebook.text` file.
- 🧪 Detects duplicate names and phone numbers.
